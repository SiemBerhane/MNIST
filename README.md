# MNIST
Training a neural network to recognise hand drawn characters using the MNIST dataset.

This project was used to learn the underlying principles of machine learning, neural networks and building familiarity with pytorch.

The architecture consits of 1 hidden layer with 30 neurons, using the cross entropy cost function and the sigmoid activation function. An accuracy of 95.9% was achieved on the test data. L2 regularisation was implemented which saw an increase in accurcacy by 0.32%.
